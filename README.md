## General Introduction

*(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)*

Utilitarian traffic optimization goals has dominated transport engineering since it appears as a proper discipline with the rise of private motorized vehicles. It has shaped our industrial and post-industrial cities that we inhabit. Modern Urbanism, as we understand it nowadays, sinks its roots at into a revolutionary scientific and technical approach towards the understanding of urban environment conditions and the efficient distribution of people, good, and resources around the city (*see Cerda*). Even Modernist urban planners and architects in the early 1900's endorsed a radical mechanistic understanding of cities (*see Chart of Athens/CIAM*). However, this scientific and positivist approach of traffic engineers contradicts the common practice in urban and city planning. Spatial planning, urban design, and collateral disciplines in the same realm, are affected by a combination of experimental data, domain expertise, ideology, and policy and political constraints in a non-straightforward decision making process in which opposed agendas promoted by different stakeholders are leverage to reach ideally a feasible compromise. In the best case scenario, many urban interventions are based on some domain expertise-backed intuition with the hope of eventually getting people's approval and political adoption.

In this context, the assessment of urban interventions in cities frequently lacks evidence support. It undermines any possibility of evaluation of results, iterative process of potential improvement, and proper informed-decision making for technical experts, decision makers, and citizens in general. The later is particularly relevant as this lack of comprehensive information on the effects of planning decisions in cities dismisses the quality of participatory processes, by masking accessible knowledge to people, and making easier to manipulate these processes (*cite on shielding participatory processes as an excuse to self justifying already taken decisions and passing the responsbility to citizens. El Diario and a new one*) 

## The Model

(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions

(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )


## Expected Results
