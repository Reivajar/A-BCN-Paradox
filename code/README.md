# Code Folder 

A different subfolder is created for each of the networks simulations:

* Net 1
* Net 2
* Net 3
* Net 4

Each folder contains all the necessary files for running the whole simulations (i.e. network file, and demand files). Additionally, the scripts required for creating the demand configuration files are as well included.
