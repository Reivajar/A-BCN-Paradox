@book{CIAM1933,
abstract = {In 1933, the fourth CIAM congress investigated thirty-three major cities, and evolved principles based on Le Corbusier's notions of the distribution and ordering of the functions of the city, including rigid zoning, housing in high-rise blocks, and wholesale destruction of existing urban fabric. Le Corbusier published the dogma of Modernist urban planning in his La Charte d'Ath{\`{e}}nes in 1943 (published as The Athens Charter in 1973), in which such functions were treated concisely, simplistically, and crudely. Great damage was inflicted on countless towns and cities through the widespread acceptance of the pernicious dogmas enshrined in the Charter, prompting the reactions of New Urbanism and a dawning realization among a few that the supposed panaceas applied after the 1939–45 war were leading to the destruction of civilized urban living.},

abstract = {8.1 An Urban Model (Rueda 1995) to Cope with the Challenges of the Beginning of the Century We are in the midst of an era change with a new paradigm and new rules. We are transforming from an industrial age to the age of information and knowledge. The industrial society was characterized by its consumption of resources and its "inde-pendence" of the laws of nature. The competitive strategy of cities was based on the consumption of resources: soil, materials, and energy. In general, the city that was better organized in the consumption of more natural resources took a competitive advantage. However, the false belief about the "independence" of the laws of nature led to the excessive use of energy and technology with a great capacity of transformation. The result has been an unsustainable impact on the systems and ecosystems of Earth. The uncertainties about the future are so grand that they oblige us to change the rules of the game and create a new paradigm that increases our capacity of resilience and preparedness. The foundations for the new paradigm are based on: 1. A change of strategy of competition among cities based on information and knowledge which involves, at the same time, the dematerialization of economy. 2. A change of metabolic regime. Industrial society was based, mainly, on the consumption of fossil fuels, as if there were no limits. The excessive consumption of fossil energy and technology was the cause of the simplification of ecosystems on all scales, that is to say, in the generation of generalized entropy with irreversible effects on much of the impacted ecosystems. The new metabolic regime has to be based on entropy.},

Under these conditions one wishes to estimate the distribution of the traffit flow. Whether a street is preferable to another one depends not only upon the quality of the road but also upon the density of the flow. If every driver takes that path which looks most favorable to him, the resultant running times need not be minimal. Furthermore it is indicated by an example that an extension of the road network may Cause a redistribution of the traffit which results in longer individual running times.},

@phdthesis{Eissfeldt2004,
abstract = {This dissertation addresses vehicle-based approaches to traffic flow modelling. Having regard to the inherent dynamic nature of traffic, the investigations are mainly focused on the question, how this is captured by different model classes. In the first part, the dynamics of a microscopic car-following model (SKM), presented in, is studied by means of computer simulations and analytical calculations. A classification of the model's behaviour is given with respect to the stability of high-flow states and the outflow from jam. The effects of anticipatory driving on the model's dynamics is explored, yielding results valid in general for this model class. In the second part, a new approach is introduced based on queueing theory. It can be regarded as a microscopic implementation of a state-dependent queueing model, using coupled queues where the service rates additionally depend on the conditions downstream. The concept is shown to reproduce the dynamics of free flow and wide-moving jams. This is demonstrated by comparison with the SKM and real world measurements. An analytical treatment is given as well. The phenomena of boundary induced phase transitions is further addressed, giving the complete phase diagrams of both models. Finally, the application of the queueing approach within simulation-based traffic assignment is demonstrated in regard to environmental impact modelling.},

@article{Geroliminis2008,
abstract = {A field experiment in Yokohama (Japan) reveals that a macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) linking space-mean flow, density and speed exists on a large urban area. The experiment used a combination of fixed detectors and floating vehicle probes as sensors. It was observed that when the somewhat chaotic scatter-plots of speed vs. density from individual fixed detectors were aggregated the scatter nearly disappeared and points grouped neatly along a smoothly declining curve. This evidence suggests, but does not prove, that an MFD exists for the complete network because the fixed detectors only measure conditions in their proximity, which may not represent the whole network. Therefore, the analysis was enriched with data from GPS-equipped taxis, which covered the entire network. The new data were filtered to ensure that only full-taxi trips (i.e., representative of automobile trips) were retained in the sample. The space-mean speeds and densities at different times-of-day were then estimated for the whole study area using relevant parts of the detector and taxi data sets. These estimates were still found to lie close to a smoothly declining curve with deviations smaller than those of individual links - and entirely explained by experimental error. The analysis also revealed a fixed relation between the space-mean flows on the whole network, which are easy to estimate given the existence of an MFD, and the trip completion rates, which dynamically measure accessibility. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Road network patterns influence traffic operational performance and road safety. A precise description of road network patterns can provide useful guidance for both design and improvement of road systems. Most previous studies have classified road network patterns using a visual inspection method. Although visual inspection is valuable in practical applications, it can be subjective and time consuming. Hence, a more reliable, automated, and quantitative approach for the classification of road network patterns is required. The objective of this study is to develop and apply a quantitative method for network pattern classification. Data analyzed are from 718 traffic analysis zones (TAZs) in Florida's Hillsborough County. Six quantitative metrics, geometric and topologic, were analyzed, and their ability to classify different road network patterns were compared. Then, a multinomial logit model was developed to classify various network patterns using the six metrics. The results show that meshedness coefficient, proportion of cul-de-sacs, and proportion of 4-legged intersections were the three most significant variables in determining network patterns. Finally, this quantitative method was validated using TAZ data from Florida's Orange County, with an accuracy of 74.7{\%}. This accuracy demonstrates the potential of the method in automatically and reliably classifying road network patterns.},

abstract = {Spatial networks display both topologic and geometric variations in their structure. This study investigates the measurement of a road network structure. Existing measures of heterogeneity, connectivity, accessibility, and interconnectivity are reviewed and three supplemental measures are proposed, including measures of entropy, connection patterns, and continuity. The proposed measures were applied to 16 test networks, which were derived from four idealized base networks: 90°, 45°, 30°, and completely connected. The results show that the differentiated structures of road networks can be evaluated by the measure of entropy; predefined connection patterns of arterial roads can be identified and quantified by the measures of ringness, webness, beltness, circuitness, and treeness. A measure of continuity evaluates the quality of a network from the perspective of travelers. Proposed measures could be used to describe the structural attributes of complicated road networks quantitatively, to compare different network structures, and to explore the structural evolution of networks in the spatial and temporal context. These measures can find application in urban planning and transportation practice. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Ohio State University.},

abstract = {No-car zone is becoming a trend in many parts of the world, mainly driven by environmental motives. Recent data has shown that both vehicle kilometers traveled and car ownership are on the decline, especially in developed countries. This has been coupled with the rise of new urban mobility concepts such as smart mobility, car sharing, and green modes. Can we push for these policies without compromising traffic circulation? The Braess Paradox (BP) suggests that road closure can, in fact, improve traffic congestion; dubbed as the Braess Paradox Detection Problem (BPDP). This study aims to leverage the BP to boost the idea of the no-car zone. To this end, we formulate the BPDP as a bilevel problem and develop a heuristic methodology (a surrogate-based algorithm) to identify roads for closure in the heart of the cities to be reclaimed for green space, pedestrian plazas, and so on. Furthermore, our proposed formulation considers travel demand elasticity resulting from road-closure schemes while solving for the BPDP. We test the methodology using a real dataset, the road network of Winnipeg. The results indicate strong evidence and justification supporting the idea of no-car zone even in the heart of highly congested cities.},
